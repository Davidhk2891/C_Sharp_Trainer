/*
Goal: Demonstrate you can combine variables, literals, and Console.Write/WriteLine to build a formatted message.
Instructions:
	1.	Create three variables:
	â€¢	string firstName = "Bob";
	â€¢	int totalMessages = 3;
	â€¢	double temperature = 34.4;
	2.	Print this exact output (punctuation and spacing must match):
        Hello, Bob! You have 3 messages in your inbox. The temperature is 34.4 celsius.
    ðŸ‘‰ Use multiple Console.Write/WriteLine calls (not interpolation).
