/*
Goal: Demonstrate you understand how to call a method from the .NET Class Library.
Instructions:
	1.	Create a new instance of the Random class called dice.
	2.	Use it to generate a random number between 1 and 6 (inclusive).
	3.	Print the result like this:
        Dice roll: 4
    ðŸ‘‰ Use interpolation in the Console.WriteLine.
    ðŸ‘‰ Donâ€™t overthink it â€” one object, one method call.
