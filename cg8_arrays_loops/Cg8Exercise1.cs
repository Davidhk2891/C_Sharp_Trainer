/*
Goal: Understand how to declare, access, and iterate through arrays using foreach

Instructions: You need to store the number of items in 5 wharehouse bins and print the total
1.	Create an integer array with 5 elements.
2.	Use a foreach loop to sum all items.
3.	Print each binâ€™s count and the running total after each iteration.
4.	Finally, print the total number of items in inventory.
