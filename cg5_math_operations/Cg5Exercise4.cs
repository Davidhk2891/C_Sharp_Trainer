/*
Goal: Demonstrate you understand how to use % to check divisibility by multiple numbers.
Instructions:
	1.	Create an int number = 30;
	2.	Print three separate lines:
        â€¢	Whether itâ€™s divisible by 3.
        â€¢	Whether itâ€™s divisible by 5.
        â€¢	Whether itâ€™s divisible by both 3 and 5.
	3.	The output should look exactly like this:
    Divisible by 3? True
    Divisible by 5? True
    Divisible by 3 and 5? True
    ðŸ‘‰ Use boolean expressions inside the interpolation, no hardcoding True/False.
